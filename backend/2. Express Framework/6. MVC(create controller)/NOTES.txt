1. Models are basically objects or the part of our code that represents data that to be used by 
the whole code, it's allows us to do the things like saving data, fetching data to or from a file.


2. Views are responsible for what users sees in the browser, the are responsible for rendering the right content to users.
Controllers are the in-between views are models, which basically works with both to keep them in sync. 
Views doesn't care about application logic, models does. 


3. Controller triggers the process of saving the data according to desired logic and also getting 
the data from models and passing them to views. So it's basically the logic part we write in routes, 
so we can create a controller folder and keep the logic of routing in there, 
that makes the code more cleaner.
